As a part of the SAP IES initiative for UX consistency, our team was one of few teams in Ariba who could start adopting the SAP Fiori design system early on for the guided beta of the redesigned app. I created a Sketch team design pattern library (which later I converted to Figma as well) so designers can share their design patterns and make the app-wide design consistent. It also can help avoid inefficiencies in development and lack of clarity when there are new team members get on board the team."}),s.default.createElement(c.default,{logo:"",title:"Project Journey 1",subtitle:"Collecting bottom-up patterns",text:"I started out reaching out to all team designers to collect all the components and their use cases in the app. We held two design critique sessions every week where designers can freely share their designs and discuss the pattern usage and its scalability before signing off to developers.

We were one of the first waves that migrated our team design library to Figma as soon as we onboarded. The goal for Figma migration was to create the pattern as flexible as possible utilizing new features such as auto-layout and frames. With one design intern, I listed out all in-development patterns and their variations. The full migration took 1 month and updated upon new projects. I also created a quick guide for Figma so new designers in Figma can take a look (with cute mini tutorials!)"}),s.default.createElement(c.default,{logo:"../../PatternLibrary_4.png",title:"Project Journey 4",subtitle:"Aligning with Design System",text:"There is still an ongoing team effort to make UX consistency across different products.
